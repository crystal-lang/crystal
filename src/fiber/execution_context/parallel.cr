module Fiber::ExecutionContext
  # Parallel execution context.
  #
  # Fibers running in the same context run both concurrently and in parallel to
  # each others, in addition to the other fibers running in other execution
  # contexts.
  #
  # The context internally keeps a number of fiber schedulers, each scheduler
  # being able to start running on a system thread, so multiple schedulers can
  # run in parallel. The fibers are resumable by any scheduler in the context,
  # they can thus move from one system thread to another at any time.
  #
  # The actual parallelism is controlled by the execution context. As the need
  # for parallelism increases, for example more fibers running longer, the more
  # schedulers will start (and thus system threads), as the need decreases, for
  # example not enough fibers, the schedulers will pause themselves and
  # parallelism will decrease.
  #
  # The parallelism can be as low as 1, in which case the context becomes a
  # concurrent context (no parallelism) until resized.
  #
  # For example: we can start a parallel context to run consumer fibers, while
  # the default context produces values. Because the consumer fibers can run in
  # parallel, we must protect accesses to the shared *value* variable. Running
  # the example without `Atomic#add` would produce a different result every
  # time!
  #
  # ```
  # require "wait_group"
  #
  # consumers = Fiber::ExecutionContext::Parallel.new("consumers", 8)
  # channel = Channel(Int32).new(64)
  # wg = WaitGroup.new(32)
  #
  # result = Atomic.new(0)
  #
  # 32.times do
  #   consumers.spawn do
  #     while value = channel.receive?
  #       result.add(value)
  #     end
  #   ensure
  #     wg.done
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # 1024.times { |i| channel.send(i) }
  # channel.close
  #
  # # wait for all workers to be done
