# An execution context creates and manages a dedicated pool of 1 or more
# schedulers where fibers will be running in. Each context manages the rules to
# run, suspend and swap fibers internally.
#
# EXPERIMENTAL: Execution contexts are an experimental feature, implementing
# [RFC 2](https://github.com/crystal-lang/rfcs/pull/2). It's opt-in and requires
# the compiler flags `-Dpreview_mt -Dexecution_context`.
#
# Applications can create any number of execution contexts in parallel. These
# contexts are isolated but they can communicate with the usual synchronization
# primitives such as `Channel` or `Mutex`.
#
# An execution context groups fibers together. Instead of associating a fiber to
# a specific system thread, we associate a fiber to an execution context,
# abstracting which system thread(s) the fibers will run on.
#
# When spawning a fiber with `::spawn`, it spawns into the execution context of
# the current fiber, so child fibers execute in the same context as their parent
# (unless told otherwise).
#
# Once spawned, a fiber cannot _move_ to another execution context. It always
# resumes in the same execution context.
#
# ## Context types
#
# The standard library provides a number of execution context implementations
# for common use cases.
#
# * `ExecutionContext::Concurrent`: Fully concurrent with limited parallelism.
# Fibers run concurrently to each other, never in parallel (only one fiber at a
# time). They can use simpler and faster synchronization primitives internally
# (no atomics, limited thread safety). Communication with fibers in other
# contexts requires thread-safe primitives. A blocking fiber blocks the entire
# thread and all other fibers in the context.
# * `ExecutionContext::Parallel`: Fully concurrent, fully parallel. Fibers
# running in this context can be resumed by multiple system threads in this
# context. They run concurrently and in parallel to each other (multiple fibers
# at a time), in addition to running in parallel to any fibers in other
# contexts. Schedulers steal work from each other. The parallelism can grow and
# shrink dynamically.
# * `ExecutionContext::Isolated`: Single fiber in a single system thread without
# concurrency. This is useful for tasks that can block thread execution for a
# long time (e.g. a GUI main loop, a game loop, or CPU heavy computation). The
# event-loop works normally (when the fiber sleeps, it pauses the thread).
# Communication with fibers in other contexts requires thread-safe primitives.
#
# ## The default execution context
#
# The Crystal runtime starts a default execution context exposed as
# `Fiber::ExecutionContext.default`. This is where the main fiber is running.
#
# Its parallelism is set to 1 for backwards compatibility reasons; Crystal used
# to be single-threaded and concurrent only. You can increase the parallelism at
# any time using `Parallel#resize`, for example:
#
# ```
# count = Fiber::ExecutionContext.default_workers_count
# Fiber::ExecutionContext.default.resize(count)
# ```
