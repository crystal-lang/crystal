# Enum is the base type of all enums.
#
# An enum is a set of integer values, where each value has an associated name. For example:
#
# ```
# enum Color
#   Red   # 0
#   Green # 1
#   Blue  # 2
# end
# ```
#
# Values start with the value 0 and are incremented by one, but can be overwritten.
#
# To get the underlying value you invoke value on it:
#
# ```
# Color::Green.value # => 1
# ```
#
# Each constant (member) in the enum has the type of the enum:
#
# ```
# typeof(Color::Red) # => Color
# ```
#
# ### Flags enum
#
# An enum can be marked with the @[Flags] attribute. This changes the default values:
#
# ```
# @[Flags]
# enum IOMode
#   Read  # 1
#   Write # 2
#   Async # 4
# end
# ```
#
# Additionally, some methods change their behaviour.
#
# ### Enums from integers
#
# An enum can be created from an integer:
#
# ```
# puts Color.new(1) # => prints "Green"
# ```
#
# Values that don't correspond to an enum's constants are allowed: the value will still be of type Color,
# but when printed you will get the underlying value:
#
# ```
# puts Color.new(10) # => prints "10"
# ```
#
# This method is mainly intended to convert integers from C to enums in Crystal.
#
# ### Question methods
#
# An enum automatically defines question methods for each member, using `String#underscore` for the
# method name. If the case of regular enums, this compares by equality (`==`). In the case of flags enums,
# this invokes `includes?`. For example:
#
# ```
# color = Color::Blue
# color.red?  # => false
# color.blue? # => true
#
# mode = IOMode::Read | IOMode::Async
# mode.read?  # => true
# mode.write? # => false
# mode.async? # => true
# ```
#
# This is very convenient in `case` expressions:
#
# ```
# case color
# when .red?
#   puts "Got red"
# when .blue?
#   puts "Got blue"
# end
# ```
