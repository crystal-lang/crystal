# A write-only `IO` object to compress data in the gzip format.
#
# Instances of this class wrap another `IO` object. When you write to this
# instance, it compresses the data and writes it to the underlying `IO`.
#
# NOTE: unless created with a block, `close` must be invoked after all
# data has been written to a `Gzip::Writer` instance.
#
# ### Example: compress a file
#
# ```
# require "gzip"
#
# File.write("file.txt", "abc")
#
# File.open("./file.txt", "r") do |input_file|
#   File.open("./file.gzip", "w") do |output_file|
#     Gzip::Writer.open(output_file) do |gzip|
#       IO.copy(input_file, gzip)
#     end
#   end
# end
# ```
