# Methods defined here are primitives because they either:
# * can't be expressed in Crystal (need to be expressed in LLVM). For example unary
#   and binary math operators fall into this category.
# * should always be inlined with an LLVM instruction for performance reasons, even
#   in non-release builds. An example of this is `Char#ord`, which could be implemented
#   in Crystal by assigning `self` to a variable and casting a pointer to it to `Int32`,
#   and then reading back the value.
