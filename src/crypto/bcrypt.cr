# Pure Crystal implementation of the Bcrypt algorithm by Niels Provos and David
# Mazi√®res, as [presented at USENIX in
# 1999](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix99/provos/provos_html/index.html).
#
# The algorithm has a maximum password length limit of 71 characters (see
# [this comment](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/39849/does-bcrypt-have-a-maximum-password-length#answer-39851)
# on stackoverflow).
#
# Refer to `Crypto::Bcrypt::Password` for a higher level interface.
#
# About the Cost
#
# Bcrypt, like the PBKDF2 or scrypt ciphers, are designed to be slow, so
# generating rainbow tables or cracking passwords is nearly impossible. Yet,
# computers are always getting faster and faster, so the actual cost must be
# incremented every once in a while.
# Always use the maximum cost that is tolerable, performance wise, for your
# application. Be sure to test and select this based on your server, not your
# home computer.
#
# This implementation of Bcrypt is currently 50% slower than pure C solutions,
# so keep this in mind when selecting your cost. It may be wise to test with
# Ruby's [bcrypt gem](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby)
# which is a binding to OpenBSD's implementation.
#
# Last but not least: beware of denial of services! Always protect your
# application using an external strategy (eg: rate limiting), otherwise
# endpoints that verifies bcrypt hashes will be an easy target.
