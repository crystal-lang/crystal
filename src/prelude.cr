# Entries to this file should only be ordered if macros are involved -
# macros need to be defined before they are used.
# A first compiler pass gathers all classes and methods, removing the
# requirement to place these in load order.

# When adding new files, use alpha-sort when possible. Make sure
# to also add them to `docs_main.cr` if their content need to
# appear in the API docs.
