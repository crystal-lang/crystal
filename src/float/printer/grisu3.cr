    # Anything that lies outside the unsafe interval is guaranteed not to round

    # If the number inside the buffer lies inside the unsafe interval but not
    # inside the safe interval then we simply do not know and bail out (returning
    # false).
    #
    # Similarly we have to take into account the imprecision of 'w' when finding
    # the closest representation of 'w'. If we have two potential
    # representations, and one is closer to both w_low and w_high, then we know
    # it is closer to the actual value v.
    #
    # By generating the digits of too_high we got the largest (closest to
    # too_high) buffer that is still in the unsafe interval. In the case where
    # w_high < buffer < too_high we try to decrement the buffer.
    # This way the buffer approaches (rounds towards) w.
    # There are 3 conditions that stop the decrementation process:
    #   1) the buffer is already below w_high
    #   2) decrementing the buffer would make it leave the unsafe interval
    #   3) decrementing the buffer would yield a number below w_high and farther
    #      away than the current number. In other words:
    #              (buffer{-1} < w_high) && w_high - buffer{-1} > buffer - w_high
    # Instead of using the buffer directly we use its distance to too_high.

  #       Hence -60 <= w.e() <= -32.
  #
  # Returns false if it fails, in which case the generated digits in the buffer
  # should not be used.
  # Preconditions:
  #  * low, w and high are correct up to 1 ulp (unit in the last place). That
  #    is, their error must be less than a unit of their last digits.
  #  * low.e() == w.e() == high.e()
  #  * low < w < high, and taking into account their error: low~ <= high~
  #  * kMinimalTargetExponent <= w.e() <= kMaximalTargetExponent
  # Postconditions: returns false if procedure fails.
  #   otherwise:
  #     * buffer is not null-terminated, but len contains the number of digits.
  #     * buffer contains the shortest possible decimal digit-sequence
  #       such that LOW < buffer * 10^kappa < HIGH, where LOW and HIGH are the
  #       correct values of low and high (without their error).
  #     * if more than one decimal representation gives the minimal number of
  #       decimal digits then the one closest to W (where W is the correct value
  #       of w) is chosen.
  # Remark: this procedure takes into account the imprecision of its input
  #   numbers. If the precision is not enough to guarantee all the postconditions
  #   then false is returned. This usually happens rarely (~0.5%).
  #
  # Say, for the sake of example, that
  #   w.e() == -48, and w.f() == 0x1234567890abcdef
  # w's value can be computed by w.f() * 2^w.e()
  # We can obtain w's integral digits by simply shifting w.f() by -w.e().
  #  -> w's integral part is 0x1234
  #  w's fractional part is therefore 0x567890abcdef.
  # Printing w's integral part is easy (simply print 0x1234 in decimal).
  # In order to print its fraction we repeatedly multiply the fraction by 10 and
  # get each digit. Example the first digit after the point would be computed by
  #   (0x567890abcdef * 10) >> 48. -> 3
  # The whole thing becomes slightly more complicated because we want to stop
  # once we have enough digits. That is, once the digits inside the buffer
