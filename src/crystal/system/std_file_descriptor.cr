# Using `O_NONBLOCK` can lead to unexpected behavior when a file descriptor is
# shared between processes, which is always the case for STDIN, STDOUT and
# STDERR. Other processes may not be resilient to file descriptors having
# O_NONBLOCK set and may even change it to return back to blocking â€”which can
# happen when spawning a child process that inherits STDIN for example.
#
# A solution (hack) is to have blocking syscalls but arm timers to send the ALRM
# signal that will cause blocking syscalls to fail and return EINTR.
#
# WARNING: this affects all interuptible syscalls! See signal(7) for the full
# list.
