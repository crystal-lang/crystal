  # Multithreaded Computations by Work Stealing" (2001) paper.

  # Once the queue is emptied, the scheduler immediately resumes its main loop,
  # and becomes a thief that will repeat the following actions until it gets a
  # runnable fiber that it can resume:
  #
  # 1. passes CPU time to another thread, allowing other threads to progress;
  # 2. tries to steal a fiber from another random scheduler;
  # 3. executes the event loop to try and fill its internal queue.
