# `Time` represents a date-time instant in
# [incremental time](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/definitions-time/#incremental_time)
# observed in a specific time zone.
#
# The calendaric calculations are based on the rules of the proleptic Gregorian
# calendar as specified in [ISO 8601](http://xml.coverpages.org/ISO-FDIS-8601.pdf).
# Leap seconds are ignored.
#
# Internally, the time is stored as an `Int64` representing seconds from epoch
# (`0001-01-01 00:00:00.0 UTC`) and an `Int32` representing
# nanosecond-of-second with value range `0..999_999_999`.
#
# The supported date range is `0001-01-01 00:00:00.0` to
# `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999_999_999` in any local time zone.
#
# ### Telling the Time
#
# There are several methods to retrieve a `Time` instance representing the
# current time:
#
# ```crystal
# Time.utc                                        # returns the current time in UTC
# Time.local Time::Location.load("Europe/Berlin") # returns the current time in time zone Europe/Berlin
# Time.local                                      # returns the current time in current time zone
# ```
#
# It is generally recommended to keep instances in UTC and only apply a
# local time zone when formatting for user display, unless the domain logic
# requires having a specific time zone (for example for calendaric operations).
#
# ### Creating a Specific Instant
#
# `Time` instances representing a specific instant can be created by
# `.utc` or `.new` with the date-time specified as individual arguments:
#
# ```
# time = Time.utc(2016, 2, 15, 10, 20, 30)
# time.to_s # => 2016-02-15 10:20:30 UTC
# time = Time.local(2016, 2, 15, 10, 20, 30, location: Time::Location.load("Europe/Berlin"))
# time.to_s # => 2016-02-15 10:20:30 +01:00 Europe/Berlin
# # The time-of-day can be omitted and defaults to midnight (start of day):
# time = Time.utc(2016, 2, 15)
# time.to_s # => 2016-02-15 00:00:00 UTC
# ```
#
# ### Retrieving Time Information
#
# Each `Time` instance allows querying calendar data:
#
# ```
# time = Time.utc(2016, 2, 15, 10, 20, 30)
# time.year        # => 2016
# time.month       # => 2
# time.day         # => 15
# time.hour        # => 10
# time.minute      # => 20
# time.second      # => 30
# time.millisecond # => 0
# time.nanosecond  # => 0
# time.day_of_week # => Time::DayOfWeek::Monday
# time.day_of_year # => 46
# time.monday?     # => true
# time.time_of_day # => 10:20:30
# ```
#
# For querying if a time is at a specific day of week, `Time` offers named
# predicate methods, delegating to `#day_of_week`:
#
# ```
# time.monday? # => true
# # ...
# time.sunday? # => false
# ```
#
# ### Time Zones
#
# Each time is attached to a specific time zone, represented by a `Location`
# (see `#location`).
# `#zone` returns the time zone observed in this location at the current time
# (i.e. the instant represented by this `Time`).
# `#offset` returns the offset of the current zone in seconds.
#
# ```
# time = Time.local(2018, 3, 8, 22, 5, 13, location: Time::Location.load("Europe/Berlin"))
# time          # => 2018-03-08 22:05:13 +01:00 Europe/Berlin
# time.location # => #<Time::Location Europe/Berlin>
# time.zone     # => #<Time::Location::Zone CET +01:00 (3600s) STD>
# time.offset   # => 3600
# ```
#
# Using `.utc`, the location is `Time::Location::UTC`:
#
# ```
# time = Time.utc(2018, 3, 8, 22, 5, 13)
# time          # => 2018-03-08 22:05:13.0 UTC
# time.location # => #<Time::Location UTC>
# time.zone     # => #<Time::Location::Zone UTC +00:00 (0s) STD>
# time.offset   # => 0
# ```
#
# A `Time` instance can be transformed to a different time zone while retaining
# the same instant using `#in`:
#
# ```
# time_de = Time.local(2018, 3, 8, 22, 5, 13, location: Time::Location.load("Europe/Berlin"))
# time_ar = time_de.in Time::Location.load("America/Buenos_Aires")
# time_de # => 2018-03-08 22:05:13 +01:00 Europe/Berlin
# time_ar # => 2018-03-08 18:05:13 -03:00 America/Buenos_Aires
# ```
#
# Both `Time` instances show a different local date-time, but they represent
# the same date-time in the instant time-line, therefore they are considered
# equal:
#
# ```
# time_de.to_utc     # => 2018-03-08 21:05:13 UTC
# time_ar.to_utc     # => 2018-03-08 21:05:13 UTC
# time_de == time_ar # => true
# ```
#
# There are also two special methods for converting to UTC and local time zone:
#
# ```
# time.to_utc   # equals time.in(Location::UTC)
# time.to_local # equals time.in(Location.local)
# ```
#
# `#to_local_in` allows changing the time zone while keeping
# the same local date-time (wall clock) which results in a different instant
# on the time line.
#
# ### Formatting and Parsing Time
#
# To make date-time instances exchangeable between different computer systems
# or readable to humans, they are usually converted to and from a string
# representation.
#
# The method `#to_s` formats the date-time according to a specified pattern.
#
# ```
# time = Time.utc(2015, 10, 12, 10, 30, 0)
# time.to_s("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %:z") # => "2015-10-12 10:30:00 +00:00"
# ```
#
# Similarly, `Time.parse` and `Time.parse!` are used to construct a `Time` instance from date-time
# information in a string, according to a specified pattern:
#
# ```
# Time.parse("2015-10-12 10:30:00 +00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z", Time::Location::UTC)
# Time.parse!("2015-10-12 10:30:00 +00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z")
# ```
#
# See `Time::Format` for all directives.
#
# ### Calculations
#
# ```
# Time.utc(2015, 10, 10) - 5.days # => 2015-10-05 00:00:00 +00:00
#
# span = Time.utc(2015, 10, 10) - Time.utc(2015, 9, 10)
# span.days          # => 30
# span.total_hours   # => 720
# span.total_minutes # => 43200
# ```
#
# ## Measuring Time
#
# The typical time representation provided by the operating system is based on
# a "wall clock" which is subject to changes for clock synchronization.
# This can result in discontinuous jumps in the time-line making it not
# suitable for accurately measuring elapsed time.
#
# Instances of `Time` are focused on telling time â€“ using a "wall clock".
# When `Time.local` is called multiple times, the difference between the
# returned instances is not guaranteed to equal to the time elapsed between
# making the calls; even the order of the returned `Time` instances might
# not reflect invocation order.
#
# ```
# t1 = Time.utc
# # operation that takes 1 minute
# t2 = Time.utc
# t2 - t1 # => ?
# ```
#
# The resulting `Time::Span` could be anything, even negative, if the
# computer's wall clock has changed between both calls.
#
# As an alternative, the operating system also provides a monotonic clock.
# Its time-line has no specfied starting point but is strictly linearly
# increasing.
#
# This monotonic clock should always be used for measuring elapsed time.
#
# A reading from this clock can be taken using `.monotonic`:
#
# ```
# t1 = Time.monotonic
# # operation that takes 1 minute
# t2 = Time.monotonic
# t2 - t1 # => 1.minute (approximately)
# ```
#
# The execution time of a block can be measured using `.measure`:
#
# ```
# elapsed_time = Time.measure do
#   # operation that takes 20 milliseconds
# end
# elapsed_time # => 20.milliseconds (approximately)
# ```
