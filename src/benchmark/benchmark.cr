# The Benchmark module provides methods for benchmarking Crystal code, giving
# detailed reports on the time taken for each task.
#
# ### Measure the number of iterations per second of each task
#
# ```
# require "benchmark"
# Benchmark.ips do |x|
#   x.report("short sleep") { sleep 0.01 }
#   x.report("shorter sleep") { sleep 0.001 }
# end
# ```
#
# This generates the following output showing the mean iterations per second,
# the standard deviation relative to the mean, and a comparison:
#
# ```text
#   short sleep    91.82 (± 2.51%)  8.72× slower
# shorter sleep   800.98 (± 1.10%)       fastest
# ```
#
# `Benchmark::IPS` defaults to 2 seconds of warmup time and 5 seconds of
# calculation time. This can be configured:
#
# ```
# Benchmark.ips(warmup: 4, calculation: 10) do |x|
#   # …
# end
# ```
#
# Make sure to always benchmark code by compiling with the `--release` flag.
#
# ### Measure the time to construct the string given by the expression: `"a"*1_000_000_000`
#
# ```
# require "benchmark"
#
# puts Benchmark.measure { "a"*1_000_000_000 }
# ```
#
# This generates the following output:
#
# ```text
#  0.190000   0.220000   0.410000 (  0.420185)
# ```
#
# This report shows the user CPU time, system CPU time, the sum of
# the user and system CPU times, and the elapsed real time. The unit
# of time is seconds.
#
# ### Do some experiments sequentially using the `#bm` method:
#
# ```
# require "benchmark"
#
# n = 5000000
# Benchmark.bm do |x|
#   x.report("times:") { n.times do
#     a = "1"
#   end }
#   x.report("upto:") { 1.upto(n) do
#     a = "1"
#   end }
# end
# ```
#
# The result:
#
# ```text
#            user     system      total        real
# times:   0.010000   0.000000   0.010000 (  0.008976)
# upto:    0.010000   0.000000   0.010000 (  0.010466)
# ```
#
# Make sure to always benchmark code by compiling with the `--release` flag.
