# A string pool is a collection of strings.
# It allows a runtime to save memory by preserving strings in a pool, allowing to
# reuse an instance of a common string instead of creating a new one.
#
# ```
# require "string_pool"
#
# pool = StringPool.new
# a = "foo" + "bar"
# b = "foo" + "bar"
# a.object_id # => 136294360
# b.object_id # => 136294336
# a = pool.get(a)
# b = pool.get(b)
# a.object_id # => 136294312
# b.object_id # => 136294312
# ```
class StringPool
  # Implementation uses open addressing scheme of hash table with [quadratic probing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_probing).
  # Quadratic probing, using the triangular numbers, avoids the clumping while keeping
  # cache coherency in the common case.
  # As long as the table size is a power of 2, the quadratic-probing method [described by "Triangular numbers mod 2^n"](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2015/02/22/triangular-numbers-mod-2n/)
  # will explore every table element if necessary, to find a good place to insert.

  # Returns the size
  #
  # ```
  # require "string_pool"
  #
  # pool = StringPool.new
  # pool.size # => 0
  # ```
  getter size : Int32

  # Creates a new empty string pool.
  #
  # The *initial_capacity* is useful to avoid unnecessary reallocations
  # of the internal buffers in case of growth. If you have an estimate
  # of the maximum number of elements the pool will hold it should
  # be initialized with that capacity for improved performance.
