# A `Hash` represents a collection of key-value mappings, similar to a dictionary.
#
# Main operations are storing a key-value mapping (`#[]=`) and
# querying the value associated to a key (`#[]`). Key-value mappings can also be
# deleted (`#delete`).
# Keys are unique within a hash. When adding a key-value mapping with a key that
# is already in use, the old value will be forgotten.
#
# ```
# # Create a new Hash for mapping String to Int32
# hash = Hash(String, Int32).new
# hash["one"] = 1
# hash["two"] = 2
# hash["one"] # => 1
# ```
#
# [Hash literals](http://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/literals/hash.html)
# can also be used to create a `Hash`:
#
# ```
# {"one" => 1, "two" => 2}
# ```
#
# Implementation is based on an open hash table.
# Two objects refer to the same hash key when their hash value (`Object#hash`)
# is identical and both objects are equal to each other (`Object#==`).
#
# Enumeration follows the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.
#
# NOTE: When using mutable data types as keys, changing the value of a key after
# it was inserted into the `Hash` may lead to undefined behaviour. This can be
# restored by re-indexing the hash with `#rehash`.

  # ===========================================================================
  # Overall explanation of the algorithm
  # ===========================================================================
  #
  # Hash implements an open addressing collision resolution method:
  # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing
  #
  # The collision resolution is done using Linear Probing:
  # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing
  #
  # The algorithm is partially based on Ruby's one but they are not exactly the same:
  # https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/a4c09342a2219a8374240ef8d0ca86abe287f715/st.c#L1-L101
  #
  # There are two main data structures:
  #
  # - @entries:
  #     A continguous buffer (Pointer) of hash entries (Entry) in the order
  #     they were inserted. This makes it possible for Hash to preserve
  #     order of insertion.
  #     An entry holds a key-value pair together with the key's hash code.
  #     An entry can also be marked as deleted. This is accomplished by using
  #     0 as the hash code value. Because 0 is a valid hash code value, when
  #     computing the key's hash code if it's 0 then it's replaced by another
  #     value (UInt32::MAX). The alternative would be to use a boolean but
  #     that involves more memory allocated and worse performance.
  # - @indices:
  #     A buffer of indices into the @entries buffer.
  #     An index might mean it's empty. We could use -1 for this but because
  #     of an optimization we'll explain later we use 0, and all other values
  #     represent indices which are 1 less than their actual value (so value
  #     3 means index 2).
  #     When a key-value pair is inserted we first find the key's hash and
  #     then fit it (by modulo) into the indices buffer size. For example,
  #     assuming we are inserting a new key-value pair with key "hello",
  #     if the indices size is 128, the key is "hello" and its hash is
  #     987 then fitting it into 128 is (987 % 128) gives 91. Lets also
  #     assume there are already 3 entries in @entries. We go ahead an add
  #     a new entry at index 3, and at position 91 in @indices we store 3
  #     (well, actually 4 because we store 1 more than the actual index
  #     because 0 means empty, as explained above).
  #
  # Open addressing means that if, in the example above, we go and try to
  # insert another key with a hash that will be placed in the same position
  # in indices (let's say, 91 again), because it's occupied we will insert
  # it into the next non-empty slot. We try with 92. If it's empty we again
  # go and insert it intro `@entries` and store the index at 92 (continuing
  # with the previous example we would store the value 4).
  #
  # If we keep the size of @indices the same as @entries it means that in the worse
  # case @indices is full and when finding a match we have to traverse it all,
  # which is bad. That's why we always make the size of @indices at least twice
  # as big as the size of @entries, so the non-empty indices will tend to be
  # spread apart with empty indices in the middle.
  #
  # Also, we always keep the sizes of `@indices` and `@entries` (`indices_size` / 2)
  # powers of 2, with the smallest size of `@indices` being 8 (and thus of
  # `@entries` being 4).
  #
  # The size of `@indices` is stored as a number that has to be powered by 2 in
  # `@indices_size_pow2`. For example if `@indices_size_pow2` is 3 then the actual
  # size is 2**3 = 8.
  #
  # Next comes the optimizations.
  #
  # The first one is that for an empty hash we don't allocate `@entries`
  # nor `@indices`, and there are a few checks against these when adding
  # and fetching elements. Sometimes hashes are created empty and remain empty
  # for some time or for the duration of the program when not used, and this
  # helps save some memory.
  #
  # The second optimization is that for small hashes (less or equal to 16 elements)
  # we don't allocate `@indices` and just perform a linear scan on `@entries`.
  # This is an heuristic but in practice it's faster to search linearly in small
  # hashes. There's another heuristic here: if we have less than or equal to 8
  # elements we just compare values when doing the linear scan. If we have between
  # 9 and 16 we first compute the hash code of the key and compare the hash codes
  # first (at this point computing the hash code plus comparing them might become
  # cheaper than doing a full comparison each time). This optimization also exists
  # in the Ruby implementation (though it seems hash values are always compared).
  #
  # A third optimization is in the way `@indices` is allocated: when the number
  # of entries is less than or equal to 128 (2 ** 8 / 2) the indexes values will range between
  # 0 and 128. That means we can use `Pointer(UInt8)` as the type of `@indices`.
  # (we can't do it for ranges between 0 and 256 because we need a value that means
  # "empty"). Similarly, for ranges between 128 and 32768 (2 ** 16 / 2) we can use
  # `Pointer(UInt16)`. This saves some memory (and the performance difference is
  # noticeable). We store the bytesize of the `@indices` buffer in `@indices_bytesize`
  # with values 1 (UInt8), 2 (UInt16) or 4 (UInt32). This optimization also exists
  # in the Ruby implementation.
  #
  # Another optimization is, when fitting a value inside the range of `@indices`,
  # to use masking (value & mask) instead of `remainder` or `%`, which apparently
  # are much slower. This optimization also exists in the Ruby implementation.
  #
  # We also keep track of the number of deleted entries (`@deleted_count`). When an
  # entry is deleted we just mark it as deleted by using the special hash value 0.
  # Only when the hash needs to be resized we do something with this instance variable:
  # if we have many deleted entries (at least as many as the number of non-deleted
  # entries) we compact the map and avoid a resize. Otherwise we remove the non-deleted
  # entries but also resize both the `@entries` and `@indices` buffer. This probably
  # avoids an edge case where one deletes and inserts an element and there is a constant
  # shift of the buffer (expensive).
  #
  # There might be other optimizations to try out, like not using Linear Probing,
  # but for now this implementaton is much faster than the old one which used
  # linked lists (closed addressing).
  #
  # All methods that deal with this implementation come after the constructors.
  # Then all other methods use the internal methods, usually using other high-level
  # methods.

  # The index of the first non-deleted entry in `@entries`.
  # This is useful to support `shift`: instead of marking an entry
  # as deleted and then always having to ignore it we just increment this
  # variable and always start iterating from it.
  # The invariant of `@first` always pointing to a non-deleted entry holds
  # (unless `@size` is 0) and is guaranteed because of how
  # `delete_and_update_counts` is implemented.
