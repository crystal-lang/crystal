# `Object` is the base type of all Crystal objects.
class Object
  # Returns `true` if this object is equal to *other*.
  #
  # Subclasses override this method to provide class-specific meaning.
  abstract def ==(other)

  # Returns `true` if this object is not equal to *other*.
  #
  # By default this method is implemented as `!(self == other)`
  # so there's no need to override this unless there's a more efficient
  # way to do it.

  # Case equality.
  #
  # The `===` method is used in a `case ... when ... end` expression.
  #
  # For example, this code:
  #
  # ```
  # case value
  # when x
  #   # something when x
  # when y
  #   # something when y
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Is equivalent to this code:
  #
  # ```
  # if x === value
  #   # something when x
  # elsif y === value
  #   # something when y
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Object simply implements `===` by invoking `==`, but subclasses
  # (notably `Regex`) can override it to provide meaningful case-equality semantics.
  def ===(other)
    self == other

  #   hasher

  # `io << self` which both would lead to an endless loop.
  #
  # Also see `#inspect(IO)`.

  # contain sufficient information to be able to recreate an object with the same value
  # (given an identical environment).
  #
  # For types that don't provide a custom implementation of this method,
  # default implementation delegates to `#to_s(IO)`. This said, it is advisable to
  # have an appropriate `#inspect` implementation on every type. Default
  # implementations are provided by `Struct#inspect` and `Reference#inspect`.

  # Usually, you can write code in a way that the compiler can safely exclude `Nil` types,
  # for example using [`if var`](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/if_var.html).

  # Returns a shallow copy (“duplicate”) of this object.
  #
  # In order to create a new object with the same value as an existing one, there
  # are two possible routes:
  #
  # * create a *shallow copy* (`#dup`): Constructs a new object with all its
  #   properties' values identical to the original object's properties. They
  #   are shared references. That means for mutable values that changes to
  #   either object's values will be present in both's.
  # * create a *deep copy* (`#clone`): Constructs a new object with all its
  #   properties' values being recursive deep copies of the original object's
  #   properties.
  #   There is no shared state and the new object is a completely independent
  #   copy, including everything inside it. This may not be available for every
  #   type.
  #
  # A shallow copy is only one level deep whereas a deep copy copies everything
  # below.
  #
  # This distinction is only relevant for compound values. Primitive types
  # do not have any properties that could be shared or cloned.
  # In that case, `dup` and `clone` are exactly the same.
  #
  # The `#clone` method can't be defined on `Object`. It's not
  # generically available for every type because cycles could be involved, and
  # the clone logic might not need to clone everything.
  #
  # Many types in the standard library, like `Array`, `Hash`, `Set` and
  # `Deque`, and all primitive types, define `dup` and `clone`.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # ```
  # original = {"foo" => [1, 2, 3]}
  # shallow_copy = original.dup
  # deep_copy = original.clone
  #
  # # "foo" references the same array object for both original and shallow copy,
  # # but not for a deep copy:
  # original["foo"] << 4
  # shallow_copy["foo"] # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
  # deep_copy["foo"]    # => [1, 2, 3]
  #
  # # Assigning new value does not share it to either copy:
  # original["foo"] = [1]
  # shallow_copy["foo"] # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
  # deep_copy["foo"]    # => [1, 2, 3]
  # ```
  abstract def dup

  # Unsafely reinterprets the bytes of an object as being of another `type`.
  #
  # This method is useful to treat a type that is represented as a chunk of
  # bytes as another type where those bytes convey useful information. As an
  # example, you can check the individual bytes of an `Int32`:
  #
  # ```
  # 0x01020304.unsafe_as(StaticArray(UInt8, 4)) # => StaticArray[4, 3, 2, 1]
  # ```
  #
  # Or treat the bytes of a `Float64` as an `Int64`:
  #
  # ```
  # 1.234_f64.unsafe_as(Int64) # => 4608236261112822104
  # ```
  #
  # This method is **unsafe** because it behaves unpredictably when the given
  # `type` doesn't have the same bytesize as the receiver, or when the given
  # `type` representation doesn't semantically match the underlying bytes.
  #
  # Also note that because `unsafe_as` is a regular method, unlike the pseudo-method
  # `as`, you can't specify some types in the type grammar using a short notation, so
  # specifying a static array must always be done as `StaticArray(T, N)`, a tuple
  # as `Tuple(...)` and so on, never as `UInt8[4]` or `{Int32, Int32}`.
