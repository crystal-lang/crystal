class Log
  # Returns and yields an `EntriesChecker` that allows checking specific log entries
  # were emitted.
  #
  # This capture will even work if there are currently no backends configured, effectively
  # adding a temporary backend.
  #
  # ```
  # require "spec"
  # require "log"
  # require "log/spec"
  #
  # Log.setup(:none)
  #
  # def greet(name)
  #   Log.info { "Greeting #{name}" }
  # end
  #
  # it "greets" do
  #   Log.capture do |logs|
  #     greet("Harry")
  #     greet("Hermione")
  #     greet("Ron")
  #
  #     logs.check(:info, /greeting harry/i)
  #     logs.next(:info, /greeting hermione/i)
  #   end
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # By default logs of all sources and severities  will be captured.
  #
  # Use *level* to only capture of the given severity or above.
  #
  # Use *source* to narrow which source are captured. Values that represent single pattern like `http.*` are allowed.
  #
  # The `EntriesChecker` will hold a list of emitted entries.
  #
  # `EntriesChecker#check` will find the next entry which matches the level and message.
  # `EntriesChecker#next` will validate that the following entry in the list matches the given level and message.
  # `EntriesChecker#clear` will clear the emitted and captured entries.
  #
  # With these methods it is possible to express expected traces in either a strict or loose way, while checking ordering.
  #
  # `EntriesChecker#entry` returns the last matched `Entry`. Useful to check additional entry properties other than the message.
  #
  # `EntriesChecker#empty` validates there are no pending entries to match.
  #
  # Using the yielded `EntriesChecker` allows clearing the entries between statements.
  #
  # Invocations can be nested in order to capture each source in their own `EntriesChecker`.
