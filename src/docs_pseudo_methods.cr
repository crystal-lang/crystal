# This file documents pseudo-methods that are implemented by the compiler

# their names prefixed by `__crystal_pseudo`. This prefix is removed by
# the docs generator making it appear as the pseudo-method.

# Returns the type of an expression.
#
# ```
# typeof(1) # => Int32
# ```
#
# It accepts multiple arguments, and the result is the union of the expression types:
#
# ```
# typeof(1, "a", 'a') # => (Int32 | String | Char)
# ```
#
# The expressions passed as arguments to `typeof` do not evaluate. The compiler
# only analyzes their return type.

end

# Returns the size of the given type as number of bytes.
#
# *type* must be a constant or `typeof()` expression. It cannot be evaluated
# at runtime.
#
# ```
# sizeof(Int32)        # => 4
# sizeof(Int64)        # => 8
# sizeof(typeof(true)) # => 1
# ```
#
# For `Reference` types, the size is the same as the size of a pointer:
#
# ```
# # On a 64 bits machine
# sizeof(Pointer(Int32)) # => 8
# sizeof(String)         # => 8
# ```
#
# This is because a `Reference`'s memory is allocated on the heap and a pointer
# to it is passed around. The size of a class on the heap can be determined
# using `#instance_sizeof`.
