  # The response `status_code` and `headers` must be configured before writing
  # the response body. Once response output is written, changing the `status`
  # and `headers` properties has no effect.
  #
  # The `HTTP::Server::Response` is a write-only `IO`, so all `IO` methods are available
  # in it.

  # A response can be upgraded with the `upgrade` method. Once invoked, headers
  # are written and the connection `IO` (a socket) is yielded to the given block.
  # The block must invoke `close` afterwards, the server won't do it in this case.
  # This is useful to implement protocol upgrades, such as websockets.
