== Name
crystal - compiler for the Crystal language

== Synopsis
*crystal* command [switches] programfile -- [arguments]

== Description
Crystal is a statically type-checked programming language. It was created with the
beauty of Ruby and the performance of C in mind.

== Usage
You can compile and run a program by invoking the compiler with a single filename:

```shell
crystal some_program.cr
```

Crystal files usually end with the .cr extension, though this is not mandatory.

Alternatively you can use the run command:

```shell
crystal run some_program.cr
```

To create an executable use the build command:

```shell
crystal build some_program.cr
```

This will create an executable named "some_program".

Note that by default the generated executables are not fully optimized.  To turn optimizations on, use the *--release*  flag:

```shell
crystal build --release some_program.cr
```

Make sure to always use *--release*  for production-ready executables and when performing benchmarks.

The optimizations are not turned on by default because the compile times are much
faster without them and the performance of the program is still pretty good without
them, so it allows to use the *crystal* command almost to be used as if it was an interpreter.

== Options
The *crystal* command accepts the following options

=== init

*init* TYPE [DIR | NAME DIR]

Generates a new Crystal project.

TYPE is one of:

*lib*	 Creates a library skeleton +
*app*	 Creates an application skeleton

This initializes the lib/app project folder as a git repository, with a license file, a README file, a shard.yml for use with shards (the Crystal dependency manager), a .gitignore file, and src and spec folders.

DIR  - directory where project will be generated

NAME - name of project to be generated (default: basename of DIR)

Options:

*-f, --force*:: Force overwrite existing files.
*-s, --skip-existing*:: Skip existing files.

=== build

*build* [options] [programfile] [--] [arguments]

Compile program.

Options:

*--cross-compile*::
Generate an object file for cross compilation and prints the command to build the executable.	The object file should be copied
to the target system and the printed command should be executed
there. This flag mainly exists for porting the compiler to new
platforms, where possible run the compiler on the target platform
directly.
*-d*, *--debug*::
Generate the output with symbolic debug symbols.  These are read
when debugging the built program with tools like lldb, gdb, valgrind etc. and provide mappings to the original source code for
those tools.
*--no-debug*::
Generate the output without any symbolic debug symbols.
*-D* _FLAG_, *--define* _FLAG_::
Define a compile-time flag. This is useful to conditionally define types, methods, or commands based on flags available at compile time. The default flags are from the target triple given
with *--target-triple*  or the hosts default, if none is given.
*--emit* [asm|llvm-bc|llvm-ir|obj]::
Comma separated list of types of output for the compiler to emit.
You can use this to see the generated LLVM IR, LLVM bitcode, assembly, and object files.
*--frame-pointers* [auto|always|non-leaf]::
Control the preservation of frame pointers. The default value,
`--frame-pointers=auto`, will preserve frame pointers on debug
builds and try to omit them on release builds (certain platforms
require them to stay enabled). `--frame-pointers=always` will always preserve them, and non-leaf will only force their preservation on non-leaf functions.
*-f* text|json, *--format* text|json::
Format of output. Defaults to text. The json format can be used
to get a more parser-friendly output.
*--error-trace*::
Show full error trace.
*--ll*:: 	 Dump LLVM assembly file to output directory.
*--link-flags* _FLAGS_::
Pass additional flags to the linker. Though you can specify those
flags on the source code, this is useful for passing environment
specific information directly to the linker, like non-standard
library paths or names. For more information on specifying linker
flags on source, you can read the "C bindings" section of the
documentation available on the official web site.
*--mcpu* _CPU_::
Specify a specific CPU to generate code for. This will pass a
-mcpu flag to LLVM, and is only intended to be used for cross-
compilation. For a list of available CPUs, invoke "llvm-as <
/dev/null | llc -march=xyz -mcpu=help".  Passing --mcpu native
will pass the host CPU name to tune performance for the host.
*--mattr* _CPU_::
Override or control specific attributes of the target, such as
whether SIMD operations are enabled or not. The default set of
attributes is set by the current CPU. This will pass a -mattr
flag to LLVM, and is only intended to be used for cross-compilation. For a list of available attributes, invoke "llvm-as <
/dev/null | llc -march=xyz -mattr=help".
*--mcmodel* default|kernel|small|medium|large::
Specifies a specific code model to generate code for. This will
pass a --code-model flag to LLVM.
*--no-color*::
Disable colored output.
*--no-codegen*::
Don't do code generation, just parse the file.
*-o*::  Specify filename of output.
*--prelude*::
Specify prelude to use. The default one initializes the garbage
collector. You can also use --prelude=empty to use no preludes.
This can be useful for checking code generation for a specific
source code file.
*-O* _LEVEL_::  Optimization mode: 0 (default), 1, 2, 3. See *OPTIMIZATIONS* for
details.
*--release*::
Compile in release mode. Equivalent to *-O3 --single-module*
*--error-trace*::
Show full stack trace. Disabled by default, as the full trace
usually makes error messages less readable and not always deliver
relevant information.
*-s*, *--stats*::
Print statistics about the different compiler stages for the current build. Output time and used memory for each compiler process.
*-p*, *--progress*::
Print statistics about the progress for the current build.
*-t*, *--time*::
Print statistics about the execution time.
*--single-module*::
Generate a single LLVM module.  By default, one LLVM module is
created for each type in a program.  *--release* implies this option.
*--threads* _NUM_::
Maximum number of threads to use for code generation. The default
is 8 threads.
*--target* _TRIPLE_::
Enable target triple; intended to use for cross-compilation. See
llvm documentation for more information about target triple.
*--verbose*::
Display the commands executed by the system.
*--static*::	 Create a statically linked executable.
*--stdin-filename* _FILENAME_::
Source file name to be read from STDIN.

=== docs

Generate documentation from comments using a subset of markdown. The output
is saved in html format on the created docs/ folder. More information about
documentation conventions can be found at <https://crystal-lang.org/docs/conventions/documenting_code.html>.

Options:

Set source refname (e.g. git tag, commit hash). The default value
is extracted from current git commit if available.
+
If this option is missing and can't be automatically determined,
the generator can't produce source code links.

=== help
Show help. Option *--help*  or *-h*  can also be added to each command for command-specific
help.

=== version
Show version.

== Optimizations
The optimization level specifies the codegen effort for producing optimal code.  It's
a trade-off between compilation performance (decreasing per optimization level) and
runtime performance (increasing per optimization level).

Production builds should usually have the highest optimization level.  Best results
are achieved with *--release*  which also implies *--single-module*

*-O0*::       No optimization (default)
*-O1*::       Low optimization
*-O2*::       Middle optimization
*-O3*::       High optimization
*-Os*::        Middle optimization with focus on file size
*-Oz*::        Middle optimization aggressively focused on file size

== Environment Variables

=== CRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR
Defines path where Crystal caches partial compilation results for faster
subsequent builds. This path is also used to temporarily store executables
when Crystal programs are run with '*crystal* run' rather than '*crystal*
build'.

=== CRYSTAL_LIBRARY_PATH
Defines paths where Crystal searches for (binary) libraries. Multiple paths
can be separated by ":".	 These paths are passed to the linker as `-L`
flags.

The pattern '$ORIGIN' at the start of the path expands to the directory
where the compiler binary is located. For example, '$ORIGIN/../lib/crystal'
resolves the standard library path relative to the compiler location in a
generic way, independent of the absolute paths (assuming the relative location is correct).

=== CRYSTAL_PATH
Defines paths where Crystal searches for required source files. Multiple
paths can be separated by ":".

The pattern '$ORIGIN' at the start of the path expands to the directory
where the compiler binary is located. For example, '$ORIGIN/../share/crystal/src' resolves the standard library path relative to the compiler location in a generic way, independent of the absolute paths (assuming the relative location is correct).

=== CRYSTAL_OPTS
Defines options for the Crystal compiler to be used besides the command
line arguments. The syntax is identical to the command line arguments. This
is handy when using Crystal in build setups, for example 'CRYSTAL_OPTS=--debug make build'.
