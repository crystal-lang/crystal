== Name
crystal - compiler for the Crystal language

== Synopsis
*crystal* command [switches] programfile -- [arguments]

== Description
Crystal is a statically type-checked programming language. It was created with the
beauty of Ruby and the performance of C in mind.

== Usage
You can compile and run a program by invoking the compiler with a single filename:

```shell
crystal some_program.cr
```

Crystal files usually end with the .cr extension, though this is not mandatory.

Alternatively you can use the run command:

```shell
crystal run some_program.cr
```

To create an executable use the build command:

```shell
crystal build some_program.cr
```

This will create an executable named "some_program".

Note that by default the generated executables are not fully optimized.  To turn optimizations on, use the *--release*  flag:

```shell
crystal build --release some_program.cr
```

Make sure to always use *--release*  for production-ready executables and when performing benchmarks.

The optimizations are not turned on by default because the compile times are much
faster without them and the performance of the program is still pretty good without
them, so it allows to use the *crystal* command almost to be used as if it was an interpreter.

== Crystal Commands

=== Main commands

*crystal-init(1)*:: Create a a new Crystal project

*crystal-build(1)*:: Compile a Crystal program

*crystal-docs(1)*:: Generate API docs for Crystal code

*crystal-env(1)*:: Print environment variables for the Crystal compiler

*crystal-eval(1)*:: Evaluate a crystal program

*crystal-play(1)*:: Run the Crystal playground

*crystal-run(1)*:: Compile and run a Crystal program

*crystal-spec(1)*:: Compile and run Crystal spec files

*crystal-clear_cache*::

Clear the compiler cache (located at 'CRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR').

*crystal-help*::

Show help. Option *--help*  or *-h*  can also be added to each command for command-specific
help.

*crystal-version*::

Show version.

=== Tools

*crystal-tool-context*:: Show context for given location

*crystal-tool-dependencies(1)*:: Show tree of required source files

*crystal-tool-expand*::  Show macro expansion for given location

*crystal-tool-flags*::   Print all macro 'flag?' values

*crystal-tool-format(1)*:: Format Crystal source files

*crystal-tool-hierarchy*::
Show hierarchy of types from file. Also show class and struct
members, with type and size. Types can be filtered with a
regex by using the *-e* flag.

*crystal-tool-implementations*::
Show implementations for a given call. Use *--cursor*  to specify the cursor position. The format for the cursor position
is file:line:column.

*crystal-tool-types*::  Show type of main variables of file.

*crystal-tool-unreachable(1)*:: Identify methods that are never called

== Optimizations
The optimization level specifies the codegen effort for producing optimal code.  It's
a trade-off between compilation performance (decreasing per optimization level) and
runtime performance (increasing per optimization level).

Production builds should usually have the highest optimization level.  Best results
are achieved with *--release*  which also implies *--single-module*

*-O0*::       No optimization (default)
*-O1*::       Low optimization
*-O2*::       Middle optimization
*-O3*::       High optimization
*-Os*::        Middle optimization with focus on file size
*-Oz*::        Middle optimization aggressively focused on file size

== Environment Variables

=== CRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR
Defines path where Crystal caches partial compilation results for faster
subsequent builds. This path is also used to temporarily store executables
when Crystal programs are run with '*crystal* run' rather than '*crystal*
build'.

=== CRYSTAL_LIBRARY_PATH
Defines paths where Crystal searches for (binary) libraries. Multiple paths
can be separated by ":".	 These paths are passed to the linker as `-L`
flags.

The pattern '$ORIGIN' at the start of the path expands to the directory
where the compiler binary is located. For example, '$ORIGIN/../lib/crystal'
resolves the standard library path relative to the compiler location in a
generic way, independent of the absolute paths (assuming the relative location is correct).

=== CRYSTAL_PATH
Defines paths where Crystal searches for required source files. Multiple
paths can be separated by ":".

The pattern '$ORIGIN' at the start of the path expands to the directory
where the compiler binary is located. For example, '$ORIGIN/../share/crystal/src' resolves the standard library path relative to the compiler location in a generic way, independent of the absolute paths (assuming the relative location is correct).

=== CRYSTAL_OPTS
Defines options for the Crystal compiler to be used besides the command
line arguments. The syntax is identical to the command line arguments. This
is handy when using Crystal in build setups, for example 'CRYSTAL_OPTS=--debug make build'.
