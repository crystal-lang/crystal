# For more details on any individual rule, run `ameba --only RuleName`.

# Indicators for comment annotations:
#
# * `Disabled`: The rule is disabled because it does not seem useful for this repo (or in general).
# * `BUG`: A bug in ameba prevents using this rule either entirely or for specific files.
# * `FIXME`: The rule seems useful, but requires some effort to resolve. That's deferred for later.
# * `TODO`: The rule might be useful, but we need to investigate whether we want to use it or not.
