# The Program

The program is a global object in which you can define methods and file-local variables.

``` ruby
# Defines a method in the program
def add(x, y)
  x + y
end

# Invokes the add method in the program
add(1, 2)
```

When invoking a method without a receiver, like `add(1, 2)`, it will be searched in the program if not found in the current type or any of its ancestors.

```ruby
def add(x, y)
  x + y
end

class Foo
  def bar
    # invokes the program's add method
    add(1, 2)

    # invokes Foo's baz method
    baz(1, 2)
  end

  def baz(x, y)
    x * y
  end
end
```

If you want to invoke the program's method, even though the current type defines a method with the same name, prefix the call with `::`:

```ruby
def baz(x, y)
  x + y
end

class Foo
  def bar
    baz(4, 2) #=> 2
    ::baz(4, 2) #=> 6
  end

  def baz(x, y)
    x - y
  end
end
```

Variables declared in a program are independent of methods:

``` ruby
x = 1

def add(y)
  x + y # error: undefined local variable or method 'x'
end

add(2)
```

Parentheses in method invocations are optional:

```ruby
add 1, 2 # same as add(1, 2)
```
