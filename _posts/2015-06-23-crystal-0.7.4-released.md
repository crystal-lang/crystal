[Crystal 0.7.4](https://github.com/manastech/crystal/releases/tag/0.7.4) has been released!

This is yet another small release which contains more fixes and performance improvements
to fibers and non-blocking IO.

A notable change is that most IO (File, Socket) has buffering that can be turned on/off,
which makes it easier to program without the need for wrapping things in a BufferedIO.

Notable additions are ARGF, which allows you to process input files or STDIN in
a uniform and easy way, and support for inline assembly.

Thank you so much for everyone contributing and giving so much love to this project!
