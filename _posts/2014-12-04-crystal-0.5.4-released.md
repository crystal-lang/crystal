[Crystal 0.5.4](https://github.com/manastech/crystal/releases/tag/0.5.4) has been released!

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/manastech/crystal) recently surpassed the 1000 stars,
which might mean there's real interest in this language.
Let's make it possible and have fun along the way! :-)

This release includes many bugs fixes and small improvements, like naming consistency.

Most notably, you can now subclass generic types.

{% highlight ruby %}
# Define a new generic class that subclass another one
class MyArray(T) < Array(T)
end

# Define a non-generic class that subclass an instance of a generic another one
class MyInt32Array < Array(Int32)
end
{% endhighlight %}

There's also a more compact way to define JSON mappings:

{% highlight ruby %}
require "json"

class Person
  json_mapping({
    name: String,
    age: Int32
  })
end

person = Person.from_json %({"name": "John", "age": 30})
p person #=> #<Person:0x10220CF20 @name="John", @age=30>
{% endhighlight %}
