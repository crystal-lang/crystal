## New commiters

Starting from this release, the Crystal team has two new core commiters:
[Jonne Haß (jhass)](https://github.com/jhass) and [Julien Portalier (ysbaddaden)](https://github.com/ysbaddaden).

Jonne started contributing to Crystal a long time ago. He built an [IRC bot](https://github.com/jhass/DeBot),
written entirely in Crystal, which runs on our IRC chatroom. If you send "\>> 1 + 2" in a channel where this bot
is, it'll reply with "3". The bot originally compiled a Crystal program and ran it a sandbox, and told you
the result of the expression. These days, it hits [play.crystal-lang.org](http://play.crystal-lang.org), which
was also written by Jonne, in Crystal.

Jonne is always sending good pull requests and participates in most of the discussions surrounding the language,
as well as giving helpful replies in our IRC chatroom. In a way, Jonne has always been part of the team, and
only now he finally has commit grants :-)

Julien has been around for some time too. He contributed with many pull request, such as a huge one which
basically refactored (in a very good way) [the socket API](https://github.com/manastech/crystal/pull/332).
He's the author of [minitest.cr](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/minitest.cr), a clone of
[Ruby's minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest); [prax.cr](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/prax.cr),
a Rack proxy server for development; and [shards](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/shards), an alternative
dependency manager.

This dependency manager, shards, is much better than Cyrstal's built-in in many ways, and so we decided
to integrate it into the compiler's toolchain. So Julien will mostly be focusing on this task, although
right now the work will remain on the shards repository until we decide the best way to integrate it
in the language tools.

We are excited to have them in the team, and we hope you too!
