[Crystal 0.11.0](https://github.com/manastech/crystal/releases/tag/0.11.0) has been released!

This release comes with syntax and semantic changes that favor consistency, standard library refactors,
many performance improvements and bug fixes. A new version of [shards](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/shards)
is included.

Read the full changelog [here](https://github.com/manastech/crystal/releases/tag/0.11.0).

## Syntax changes

### Type declarations and uninitialized variables

Before this release, `::` was used to declare the type of instance variables.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Point
  @x :: Int32
  @y :: Int32
  # ...
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

Additionally, `::` inside a method had the meaning of declaring a variable with uninitialized (unsafe) contents:

{% highlight ruby %}
def method
  # Allocate stack memory, don't zero it
  buffer :: UInt8[1024]
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

This was confusing, as a same syntax had two meanings. Now, the `::` syntax is gone. To declare the type
of a variable you use a single colon (`:`):

{% highlight ruby %}
class Point
  @x : Int32
  @y : Int32
  # ...
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

This is also consistent with the syntax of type restrictions:

{% highlight ruby %}
def add(x : Int32, y : Int32) : Int32
  x + y
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

To declare a variable with uninitialized content you now do:

{% highlight ruby %}
def method
  # Allocate stack memory, don't zero it
  buffer = uninitialized UInt8[1024]
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

which is much more explicit and clear.

Additionally, type annotations are now allowed in class and global variables.

To upgrade your code to this new syntax, just run `crystal tool format` on your project: the formatter still
understand the old syntax and will modify your code to use the new syntax :-)

### Heredocs

String heredocs are now more powerful and convenient: leading space is removed from heredoc lines according
to the leading space of the closing delimiter. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Same as "Hello\n  world"
<<-STRING
  Hello
    world
  STRING

# Same as "  Hello\n    world"
<<-STRING
    Hello
      world
  STRING
{% endhighlight ruby %}

The old behaviour was inconvenient because it forced you to write all content aligned to the left. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Program
  USAGE = <<-USAGE
Usage: crystal [command] [switches] [program file] [--] [arguments]

Command:
    init                     generate a new project
    ...
USAGE
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

Now you can write it like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Program
  USAGE = <<-USAGE
    Usage: crystal [command] [switches] [program file] [--] [arguments]

    Command:
        init                     generate a new project
        ...
    USAGE
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

Thank you [rhysd](https://github.com/rhysd) for suggesting this change.

## Semantic changes

Previously, `return` could be used inside a captured block. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def capture(&block : -> Int32)
  block
end

def method
  proc = capture do |x|
    return 10 if x == 1
    2
  end
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

A `return` usually returns from a method, bypassing the block, but in the case of a captured
block the `return` just exited the block and gave it a value. This was inconsistent, so now
you have to use `next`, which is the way you give a block it's value in other situations. `return`
will give an error in this case.

## Standard library changes

A huge refactor has been done to `HTTP::Server` to support streaming and upgrading protocols.

Previously you would write a server like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
HTTP::Server.new(8080) do |request|
  HTTP::Response.ok "text/plain", "Got #{request.path}!"
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

The problem with this approach is that there's no way to stream content to the response body. Well,
there was a way: you would set an IO as the response body, but this was awkward and complex.

Now the handler receives a context which includes a response object to which you can write to.

{% highlight ruby %}
HTTP::Server.new(8080) do |context|
  context.response.content_type = "text/plain"
  context.response.print "Got #{context.request.path}!"
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

Streaming data is now super easy:

{% highlight ruby %}
HTTP::Server.new(8080) do |context|
  context.response.content_type = "text/plain"
  10.times do |i|
    context.response.puts i
    context.response.flush
    sleep 1
  end
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

The above code will write the numbers from 0 to 9, waiting 1 second between each write.

## Performance improvements

Before this release `libpcl` was used for fiber context switch. Now this is done with inline
assembly, which not only frees us from `libpcl`, it also works much faster.

Additionally, `URI.parse` was rewritten by [will](https://github.com/will) to not use regular
expressions, which gave it a huge performance improvement.

## Bug fixes

The compiler's code now does an initial pass to declare all classes, macros and methods. This
got rid of many bugs that depended on order of declaration, forcing you to use some ugly workarounds.

## Shards 0.6.0

[ysbaddaden](https://github.com/ysbaddaden)'s shards comes with two new commands: `prune` (removes extraneous libs)
and `init` (creates an initial shard.yml), as well as some bug fixes. Read the changelog
[here](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/shards/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

## Thank you!

We want to thank everyone that contributes, discusses, promotes and critizices this project. We
never stop being amazed at how much you do and help us grow the community, slowly getting us to `1.0`.

Happy crystaling!
