# $ ./spec/debug/test.sh [lldb|gdb]
#
# The argument selects one of the debuggers, defaulting to LLDB.
#
# It will use the ./spec/debug/driver.cr program to execute
# the files explicitly listed at the end of this file.
#
# Those files have magic comments to build a script for a debugger session
# and a FileCheck file with assertions over that session.
#
# The magic comments interpreted by the driver are:
#
# * `# print: expr`
#   Prints the given expression in the debugger, e.g. a variable.
# * `# check: pattern`
#   Asserts that the debugger output matches the given FileCheck pattern.
# * `# xxx-check: pattern`
#   Like above, but only effective if `xxx` matches the debugger name. Has no
#   effect for the other debuggers.
#
# These comments should then be followed by a call to `debugger` which sets up
# the actual breakpoint.
#
# In ./tmp/debug you can find a dump of the session and the assertion file.
