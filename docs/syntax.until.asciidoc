==== until

An `until` executes its body until its condiiton is _truthy_.
An `until` is just syntax sugar for a `while` with the condition negated:

[source,ruby]
-------------
until some_condition
  do_this
end

# The above is the same as:
while !some_condition
  do_this
end
-------------

An `until` can also be used in its suffix form, causing the body to be
executed at least once. `break` and `next` can also be used inside an `until`.
