# These jobs are smoke tests for platforms where we don't rund full tests.
# They ensure that std_spec, compiler_spec and the compiler itself at least
# compile for the target with --cross-compile. But the binaries are not linked
# and executed. So this does not validate correct behaviour.
#
# The list of supported platforms is extracted from the lib_c bindings:
#
# ```terminal-session
# $ find src/lib_c -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -printf '%P\n' | sort
# aarch64-darwin
# aarch64-linux-gnu
# aarch64-linux-musl
# arm-linux-gnueabihf
# i386-linux-gnu
# i386-linux-musl
# x86_64-darwin
# x86_64-dragonfly
# x86_64-freebsd
# x86_64-linux-gnu
# x86_64-linux-musl
# x86_64-netbsd
# x86_64-openbsd
# x86_64-windows-msvc
# ```
#
# Platforms for which we currently run full tests are excluded from this workflow.
