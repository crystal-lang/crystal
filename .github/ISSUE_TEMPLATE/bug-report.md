# Bug Report

Make sure to review these points before submitting issues - thank you!

- Make sure a similar issue does not exist yet: use the search box, search engine and look at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crystal-lang).
- **Include reproducible code**: we should be able to paste it into an editor, compile and run it and get the same error as you. Otherwise it's impossible for us to reproduce the bug.
- Don't **only** use `play.crystal-lang.org` or `carc.in`: code might be lost and the issue will remain incomplete. Write code in the issue itself.
- Reduce code, if possible, to the minimum size that reproduces the bug.
- If all of the above is impossible due to a large project, create a branch that reproduces the bug and point us to it.
- Include Crystal compiler version (`crystal -v`) and OS. If possible, try to see if the bug still reproduces on master.
